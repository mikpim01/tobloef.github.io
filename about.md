Hello, I'm Tobias, a freelance developer from Denmark. When I'm not studying computer science or working as a .NET developer, I tinker with all sorts of fun side projects, some of which I write about on this site. Right now I'm really interested in security and doing CTFs, but I also do a lot of full-stack web development. Next year I really look forward to diving into AI and machine learning.
