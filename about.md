Hello, I'm Tobias, a freelance developer from Denmark. By day, I work as full stack JavaScript and Windows WPF developer, and care a lot about writing high quality code. By might, or whenever I have some spare time, I love to tinker with all sorts of fun side projects, some of which I write about on this site.
