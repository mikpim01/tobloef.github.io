Hello, I'm Tobias, a freelance developer from Denmark. By day, I study software devlopment at ITU Copenhagen, work as full stack JavaScript and Windows developer, and care a lot about writing high quality code. Whenever I have some spare time, I love to tinker with all sorts of fun side projects, some of which I write about on this site.
