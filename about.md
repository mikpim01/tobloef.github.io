Hello, I'm Tobias LÃ¸fgren, a consultant software engineer from Denmark. By day I study software devlopment at the IT University of Copenhagen and work as full stack JavaScript developer at [Wine Dark Sea](https://winedarksea.co.uk/). Whenever I have some spare time I love to tinker with all sorts of fun side projects, some of which I write about on this site. 

Feel free to follow me on twitter [@tobloef](https://www.twitter.com/tobloef).

You can contact me on [tobloef@gmail.com](mailto:tobloef@gmail.com).
